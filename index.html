          <h3>Developer <span>& Designer</span></h3>
          <p>Thank you for spending time visiting my website! I'm a new graduate student who is pursuing the carrer path of full-stack development, I really love learning designing perfect-looking websites. Based on my past experiences on designing websites, I can confidently provide clean code and pixel perfect design. I'm also really interested in animations which can make the website become way more interactive! At the same time, I'm also diving deeper and deeper into different APIs as well as different algorithms and tools which help manage data on the back-end! I really can't say I'm good at this right now, but I strongly believe I will get better and better as I continue learning throughout my career path!

            <h2>First Year to US</h2>
            <h4>26th Aug, 2014</h4>
            <p>I was born in China, and in order to have more opportunities and life skills, I came to US by myself at my age of 14. However, I really had some fun experiences getting used to this new environment!</p>

            <h4>28th Aug, 2018 ~ 2019</h4>
            <p>After four years of study in high school, I eventually chose to go to University of Texas at Dallas for college because of in-state tuition. At the first two years of college, I was wandering around different restaurants, I worked at a Japanese Sushi restaurant and got paid as a chief assisstant, I also worked at a Chinese BBQ restaurant and got paid as waiter, and at the same time I worked at another Chinese hotpot restaurant and got paid as waiter as well. However,It was really tired during that period of time. However, I feel kinda of regretful and thankful at the same time if you let me recall those experiences, I regret on how confused and unstructured I was about future back then, but on the other side, I feel really appreciate on all these experiences, they really taught me a lot. From working as a waiter, I learned the necessity of effeciency. And from being a chief assisstant, my interest on cooking has been totally stirred up! Based on the first two years of college life, I learned that life is not just about attending different classes, it's about learning from different experiences!</p>

            <h2>First Time Setting up my own website</h2>
            <h4>28th Aug, 2020 ~ 2021</h4>
            <p>On my third year in college, because it's during pandemic, ecommerce was really popular during that time. I tried to learn from different youtubers and started setting up my own online store on the Shopify, this was the first time I got in touch with the front-end website design, although it's on a templete-ready plateform. I learned how to navigate Google Trend as well as how to advertise and target specific audiences based on the analysis of Google Trend. It was really fun! I was selling 3M N95 masks, Purell sanitizers, as well as different kinds of rubber gloves during that time, this experience really taught me the importance of opportunities from the timing perspective. At the time when demand is far greater than the existing supplies in the market, that's the time you need to show up and make a gamble! But eventually what sad is I have to shut down the store because of my citizenship status. </p>

            <h4>28th Aug, 2021 ~ 2022</h4>
            <p>Because of all different kinds of restrictions on international students, I eventually ended up interning at a small ecommerce company. I helped them manage their online store and at the same time exploring new markets and new products. This company sell and recycle different kinds of electronic devices. I was having a great time working with them! On this year, I made my mind that I will pursue the career path of full-stack development, I learned java, html, css, javeScript as well as React step by step by doing different small projects. I enjoyed all the projects on the Fronted Mentor, it really taught me all the necessary skills to design a perfect looking and fully responsive website!</p>
